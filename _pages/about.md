I am a Ph.D. student at the [Courtant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://nyu.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Rajesh Ranganath]() and [Prof. Sumit Chopra](). My research interests lie in the intersection of generative models, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning for healthcare.
