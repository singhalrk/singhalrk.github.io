I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at [NYU Courtant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/), advised by [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) and [Sumit Chopra](https://spchopra.org/) and part of the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/cilvr-people/) group. I work on diffusion models, generative models, and applications of machine learning in healthcare. 

I did a BA/MS in Mathematics at Courant as well, where I worked on stochastic processes and random graph theory with [Lai-Sang Young](https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/YOUNG_Lai-Sang.html) and [Yuri Bakhtin](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bakhtin/).
